**Work:** I am currently an intern at Microsoft working as a PM and Software Engineer.
{: .notice--success}

**Research:** My research is based out of the Vector Institute of Technology and MIT Critical Data to better understand how we can meaningfully use machine learning in healthcare. More recently, I have become interested in finding ways to improve methods in domain generalization research. I am also broadly interested in the areas of fairness, ethics and policy in machine learning. Some of my prior research through the COVID-19 pandemic has been heavily influenced through a startup I founded and led called [Flatten](https://flatten.ca).

**The Outdoors:** Outside of academic work, I love to swim, bike and run. I am currently competing for the U25 Men's Canadian National Triathlon Team and hopefully (if COVID-19 allows for it), get to represent Canada at the World Championships in Bermuda this fall. I love to travel (been to almost 50 countries so far) and hope to get back to it when the world recovers from the pandemic..

**School:** In between research and training, I am also an Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto majoring in machine learning.

**Other:** Some other fun things I am doing right now include: co-host of a podcast called [Time Horizons](https://shreyjain13.github.io/final/podcast/), and I am part of the [Interact Fellowship](https://joininteract.com/).
