## Shaans a Bum

I am currently an intern at Microsoft working as a PM and Software Engineering intern.

My research is based out of the Vector Institute of Technology and MIT Critical Data to better understand how we can meaningfully use machine learning in healthcare. More recently, I have become interested in finding ways to improve domain generalization by better understanding how we measure robustness and what makes pre-trained transformers more robust to distribution shifts. Expect a blog on domain generalization soon.

Outside of academic work, I love to swim, bike and run. I am currently competing for the U25 Men's Canadian National Triathlon Team and hopefully (if COVID-19 allows for it), get to represent Canada at the World Championships in Bermuda this fall. I also love to travel (been to almost 50 countries so far) and hope to get back to it when the world recovers from the pandemic.

In between research and training, I am also an Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto majoring in machine learning.

Some other fun things I am doing right now include: co-host of a podcast called Time Horizons, part of the Interact Fellowship.
