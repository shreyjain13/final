I am the co-host of a podcast with my friend [ Arthur Allshire](https://allshire.org).

Our podcast is very chill (meaning not a specific cadence that we release content on) and just do it to stimulate interesting discussions that we think could be meaningful for a broader community of individuals.

Our podcast is targeted at having conversations with people that working on projects that we find interesting and are genuinely going to push the frontiers of progress in the future. We try to find guests who have "opinions".
