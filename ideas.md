### From Sand to Chips: Who are the players?

Go from the silicon harvesters to ASML, to TSMC to better understand who are all the key players involved in chip design and manufacturing.

Answer some key questions when doing so:

- What makes this player able to execute so well? (We understand TSMC quite well, but not its dependencies)
- What is restricting Canada from being able to replicate?


### Triathlon is my domain generalization task

Every race I do, I feel like I need to shift the variables in my parameters to know how I need to train (ie, course elevation, competition, and more) and only the more times I test on a new environment does my "model" (ability to race well) get better.

### Oil from sugar canes and the new synthetic biology era

These two feel very similar in their goals. What failed from sugar canes and who are the key players (other than Zimmergen and Ginko) working on synthetic bio.

### When is competition good?

Competition is great for public markets, making sports fun, but when are they bad? With friends?  

### Making 3B1B videos for your academic papers / conferences?

Create a 3 Blue 1 Brown Video for every theory paper you produce. If you were ever curious (because I eventually do want to get to it), check out [here](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).
