Questions I ask myself when I write a piece of work:

* What do you really want to say?
* What are all of the different things you could say? Refine that and realize that you can never have everything.
* What authority do I bring to this topic?
* What is your tone?
* Is this a topic I should listen more than I should speak?
* Is it personal or objective? It is easy to make it personal and then go broad
* Don't limit yourself and don't edit stuff as you go and just go fast
* First instincts are often the best
