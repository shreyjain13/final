### Making 3B1B videos for your academic papers / conferences?

Create a 3 Blue 1 Brown Video for every theory paper you produce. If you were ever curious (because I eventually do want to get to it), check out [here](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).

### Random topics I am trying to think about more formally

* Cryptography and its long term applicaitons in data sharing
* Global markets
