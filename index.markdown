I am currently an intern at Microsoft working as a PM and Software Engineer.

My research is based out of the Vector Institute of Technology and MIT Critical Data to better understand how we can meaningfully use machine learning in healthcare. More recently, I have become interested in finding ways to improve methods in domain generalization research. I am also broadly interested in the areas of fairness, ethics, and policy in machine learning but hope to focus on this after getting some grounding in the methods / theory based work. Some of my prior research through the COVID-19 pandemic has been heavily influenced through a startup I founded and led called [Flatten](https://flatten.ca).

Outside of academic work, I love to swim, bike and run. I am currently competing for the U25 Men's Canadian National Triathlon Team and hopefully (if COVID-19 allows for it), get to represent Canada at the World Championships in Bermuda this fall. I love to travel (been to almost 50 countries so far) and hope to get back to it when the world recovers from the pandemic. If we are in the same town and you like to bike, run, or swim open water, let's meet up!


In between research and training, I am also an Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto majoring in machine learning.


Some other fun things I am doing right now include: co-host of a podcast called [Time Horizons](https://shreyjain13.github.io/final/podcast/) and I am part of the [Interact Fellowship](https://joininteract.com/).
