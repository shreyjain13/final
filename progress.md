Here are some random links I think are important to read for progress

Some promising projects:

PAPRA: https://benjaminreinhardt.com/parpa

NIH does actually fund high risk projects: https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/our-second-chance-program-nih-transformative-research-applicants. I found it interesting that of the 120 proposals that they NIH recieved, the four granted were for healthcare / biology related topics. 

Atlantic Article

My favorite parts of this article:

* Only in the two centuries between Columbus and Newton was the idea of individualism bringing about progress presented. Prior, "ancestor worship" was a prodominent way of thinking.

Another interesting piece: Science the Endless Frontier

Notes from this article:

This article has me thinking initially how innovation and progress is spiked during a time of crises. It seems like there was a serious transparency issue for the government and research teams to make what they developed for the war public knowledge for everyone else.

Roosevelt rapidly wanted to make the knowledge from the military efforts available for scientific knowledge. Same with medicine and education.


The idea on linear progress is interesting: https://worksinprogress.co/issue/innovation-is-not-linear/

TLDR we don't have enough people doing basic research. Only applied and developmental research.

Plastic was not created until chemsistry was well established. Electric power is not possible without electromagnetism.Leo Bakeland for Baekelite (synethic plastic) and Faraday for electricity relied on **basic** research.

The development is possible but after a while it does plateau.

"Sometimes when an invention is produced by tinkering, science cannot explain its operating characteristics, or even why it works at all. Aspirin was first marketed in 1899, but its mechanism of action wasnâ€™t explained until 1971."

"When the right researchers are brought together in the right environment, this iterative process combining both science and engineering can even be driven forward by the same people, in the same lab, on a single project."

"Some of the greatest researchers were those who were able to pivot rapidly from discovery to invention, or vice versa, as the opportunity arose. The master of this was Louis Pasteur, a pioneer of microbiology."
